• Problem
– Given a number of documents, compute the word semantic similarity using MapReduce
– Input: A text file, each line represents a document
– Output: A list of term-term pairs sorted by their similarity descending
- t1 t2 s1
- t3 t4 s2

• Sub-problems
– Compute Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for each term
– Compute term similarity
– Sort the term similarity
